Please, RUN portuguese-bank.py AND NOT portuguese+duration.py
NOTE: Just run the Visualisation Separately because the outcome runs 
and gets shown before the viz. 

We see that the feature ‘duration’,which tells us about the duration of the last call in seconds, 
is more than twice for the customers who bought the products than for customers who didn’t.
I didn't add duration in the model because it is something which can't be controlled by the caller.
Therefore, maybe as a company you should ask your sales team to make longer calls
It increases the profit from 49% to 60% (Portuguese+duration.py)

Campaign - which denotes the number of calls made during the current campaign,
are lower for customers who purchased the products. This increased the profit from
49% to 52%.

Should target blue-collar jobs, and people with no education because those are the people 
who will readily buy these deposits. People with no education shouldn't be confused with 
people who have no source of income. Target blue collar because these people are involved
with physical labour and will need money in future during emergency.

poutcome - If your previous marketing campaign was a "success", you should definetly try again, as it will 
result in success. But, if you failed in previous attempt, don't try hard. 
And, definetly try for the non-existent.

months - Try all year round but, try harder during March, April, May, June, August, October, and 
	November.
